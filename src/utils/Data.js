      "About Too Young For Cancer: The inspiring story of a stage IV cancer survivor’s journey through a complex and biased medical system to get a diagnosis and the treatment that would save her life, and how she found her life’s purpose through community and advocacy. New Year’s Eve 2020 was supposed to be a turning point to better days for 29-year-old Katie Coleman. Instead, she found herself in the ER processing the earth-shattering news of a stage IV cancer diagnosis, one that had come after years of being assured she was “too young for cancer” and a repeated misdiagnosis of anxiety. Too Young for Cancer tells the story of Katie’s journey from diagnosis with an ultra-rare cancer through treatment, recovery and a life-altering shift in perspective. Too Young for Cancer highlights the absolute best and worst in healthcare and uncovers the silver linings and beauty of humanity filling the space in between.",
