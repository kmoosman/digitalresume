                    In "Life Refocused," I share my personal journey of being
                    diagnosed with an extremely rare (single digits, worldwide,
                    in history) Stage IV cancer on New Year's Eve 2020, as a 29
                    year old newly wed. I take readers through the shock and
                    disbelief I struggled to overcome after years of being told
                    by doctors that I was "too young for cancer" and the
                    difficult decisions I had to make, such as forgoing my
                    honeymoon and moving across the country in search of
                    experts.{" "}

                    The type of tumor I had is typically supposed to be benign,
                    it never spreads. Except in my case of course, in which case
                    the tumor on my right kidney, that was larger than a
                    softball, spread to my liver with over 15 tumors throughout.
                    Giving me a Stage IV cancer diagnosis that would render me
                    inoperable. I take readers through what it was like to go
                    from being inoperable with an advanced cancer and a bleak
                    prognosis to no active cancer through a series of
                    serendipitous events that would teach me many life lessons
                    along the way, that anyone looking to make the most of life
                    can learn from.

                              My name is Katie and I am a cancer survivor and
                              patient advocate. I was diagnosed with a rare
                              stage IV cancer at 29-years old and just two
                              months after getting married, but I have not let
                              cancer define me. Instead, I have used my personal
                              experience to become a visible patient advocate
                              for kidney cancer. My story has been featured in
                              national news articles such as NBC, Today and
                              Yahoo and it was highlighted on the national CBS
                              Evening News as well. I'm an introvert by nature
                              so sharing my life publicly has been a big change
                              but the experience of sharing my story has been
                              incredibly rewarding as I've been able to connect
                              with other patients and survivors and the process
                              has helped has helped me grow in ways I never
                              thought possible.

                              In addition to my advocacy work, I am a software
                              engineer and I have even found a new job during my
                              treatment. I was transparent about my diagnosis
                              through the interview process which gained a lot
                              of attention but helped provide me with insight on
                              how navigate the difficult task. I am also the
                              founder of a non-profit organization and I am
                              currently starting a new podcast with another

                              navigating life and treatment with cancer and
                              provide a platform for other patients to share

                              It’s been a long journey of treatment, surgery and
                              procedures but I’ll spare you the details to
                              prevent this from turning into a three part novel.
                              It’s been a wild ride so far and while cancer has
                              become my greatest & most fierce enemy, it has
                              also become my greatest strength. Which is how
                              I’ve found myself here, writing a blog, about how
                              cancer has made me not only a better person but a
                              better employee. So, let’s talk about it by
                              breaking down a few qualities crucial to success
                              in almost any role.

                            When I look back on the twenty-nine year old newly
                            wed, with tear stained cheeks, receiving a stage IV
                            cancer diagnosis in the ER that cold December night
                            - I see a familiar face but a woman almost
                            unrecognizable to me now. Over the next two years,
                            whether I liked it or not, cancer would soon shift
                            and reshape every aspect of my life. It would test
                            and prove my marriage. It’d reach deep into the
                            depths of my greatest fears and bring with it great
                            sorrow and despair. But over time it’d also bring
                            hope, love and gratitude. It would require me to
                            speak up, learn to advocate for myself and force me
                            to find my voice. As the once shy, quiet girl in the
                            back of the room, I’d soon bring my life to the
                            center stage.
