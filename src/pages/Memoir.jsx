                The inspiring story of a stage IV cancer survivor‚Äôs journey
                through a complex and biased medical system to get a diagnosis
                and the treatment that would save her life, and how she found
                her life‚Äôs purpose through community and advocacy. New Year‚Äôs
                Eve 2020 was supposed to be a turning point to better days for
                29-year-old Katie Coleman. Instead, she found herself in the ER
                processing the earth-shattering news of a stage IV cancer
                diagnosis, one that had come after years of being assured she
                was ‚Äútoo young for cancer‚Äù and a repeated misdiagnosis of
                anxiety. Too Young for Cancer tells the story of Katie‚Äôs journey
                from diagnosis with an ultra-rare cancer through treatment,
                recovery and a life-altering shift in perspective. Katie starts
                her journey shy, timid, and frightened of an intimidating
                medical world, but as she learns how to advocate for herself,
                she faces her own mortality with bravery and finds herself at
                top cancer institutions arguing her case for a radical and
                high-risk surgery that could change her life forever. With
                support from her husband; innovative doctors; and a diverse
                community of cancer survivors and fighters, Katie finds her
                life‚Äôs purpose to advocate not only for herself but also for
                others who are fighting just as hard for their lives. Too Young
                for Cancer highlights the absolute best and worst in healthcare
                and uncovers the silver linings and beauty of humanity filling
                the space in between.

                Pre-orders can be very impactful for new titles. They help to
                build buzz around the book and show publishers that there is
                interest in the book so retailers and store can stock it. This
                can help to increase the number of copies printed and can help
                to get the book on bestseller lists. The more pre-orders, the
                more likely the book is to be a success.{" "}

                  But on a personal level, pre-orders and support for this book
                  mean the world to me personally as I am donating my portion of
                  the proceeds from it back to research because more patients
                  deserve outcomes like I've had so far.{" "}
